# 🧠 GenAI_Test_Automation

An experimental framework integrating **TestRigor**, **DeepSeek**, and **Ollama** to explore **AI-assisted test automation**.  
Combines natural-language test generation, self-healing scripts, and GenAI models to enhance test coverage and reduce maintenance effort.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how AI models can support Quality Assurance through:
- Automated test case generation from requirements.
- Natural-language test execution with TestRigor.
- Predictive analytics for flaky test detection using DeepSeek.
- Integration with local LLMs (Ollama) for test intent analysis.
